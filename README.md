# github_flutter_repo

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

Flutter version: 3.16.8

I have done this project following clean architecture SOLID principals. 
Used bloc for state management and getIt for dependency injection shared_preferences for caching mechanism.
I wanted to implement TDD but could not due to time constraints.
